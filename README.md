Written in go!

2. Whatever (Frontend)
3. Postgresql with pgVector that stores manuals of machiens that you own in an vector database (mounted via `/local/manuals:/pg/manuals` or whatever)
4. Endpoint to upload manuals
5. (If im feeling super fancy) WebSearch for the manual given the name of the machine or asking the user question about which year how money buckz they spended on it blaa to determine which machine it could be
6. Giving Advice what could be broken
7. Giving Advice how it could be fixed also maybe a shopping list of what we need to fix it
